988,2601882,Would target accept my request to take saturday off?,"So i recently got hired about 2 weeks ago and so fse has been pretty good. I work in Tech and while sometimes it is stressful, for the most part its quite good. My problem is that now they randomly select my hours as opposed to the first week where i worked from 7-3 and from 8-4. I‚Äôm ok with opening shifts but its the closing shifts that i really hate‚Ä¶ but ok fine closing shifts i can handle, what i really dont like is that they put me closing shift on Saturday.

I am currently a college student and the balance between work and studying has been extremely tumultuous. I recently missed turning in an essay because Target couldnt change my hours on saturday and I had planned to dedicate my entire day to finish the essay!

I‚Äôm ok with working Saturday as long its morning shift, however they already have somebody working the mornings and my TL doesn‚Äôt want to make the change because I usually get closing shifts (2-10,3-11 and sometimes 4-12).

I have noticed that is becoming more... let's say bloated and features are added constantly.

I admit that personally I don't use many of the features:

* Bing search in Sidebar
* Games
* Read Aloud
* Sidebar
* Math Solver
* Citations
* Alerts and Tips
* Smart Actions
* Mini menu on text selection
* Visual Search - its locked on Bing
* Edge Bar
* Edge Bar feed
* Edge Rewards
* Typosquatting checker 

As you can see that these are only some of the features that, probably, many of the users do not actually use daily.

So, is there any possibility a lightweight version of Edge will be available in the future?

988,2309468,Finally left.,"I recently quit my job over at Target. They switched our inbound shift from overnights to 4am (which I had no issue with, but I was a little bummed out). What pushed me over the edge was how quickly the team leads attitudes changed the moment we got to 4ams. They became pushy, rude and very unprofessionally mean! I get that being in the store with the SD and other managers added a little pressure on them but it‚Äôs no excuse. One of my team leads would push the truck line so hard that she broke 5/6 nutcrackers that were in a box sent down the line. When I told her about the broken parts, I was instructed to stock them as normal but ‚Äòput them in the back‚Äô. She also began trashing employees on our team when they weren‚Äôt around, which could only lead me to imagine what she would say about me when I wasn‚Äôt around. 

For $15 an hour with no further incentive to work harder or faster, I decided there was literally no point in pushing myself that hard physically and mentally. People don‚Äôt leave jobs, they leave management. I loved my overnight shift, and believe it was a much better space for my team. The switch to 4am pushed a lot of people out the door. I would never recommend working here for anyone, especially in inbound. It was brutal. I have a new job and a new seasonal part time job and I feel good to be excited about work again. Hope you all are hangin in there! You do not deserve to be looked and talked down to. You‚Äôre people, you work hard, and you‚Äôre doing your best. If it‚Äôs not enough, you can find something else.

988,2647200,"TL being too harsh on me, or am I actually not working hard enough?","FF team member here, been with target just over 1.5 years, done nothing but fulfillment since. My numbers have been consistently high since I started, typically being within the top 3 team members for speed and lowest INF rating. Some days this varies; days where I have to pull strictly ship alones or days where the entire team struggles with INF (example Christmas ornaments), but generally speaking my productivity has always been relatively high. 

About half a year ago I switched from opening/mids to strictly closing. Closing at my store has been incredibly rough; we‚Äôve always struggled with evening staffing and call outs, which has typically left me alone to finish out hundreds of units of SFS, with no time to do them in. This results in the workload not getting done, or me staying late into OT just to get it done. 

We got a new team lead from another department about 4 months ago, and I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm being treated horribly. I‚Äôve had several days where as soon as I clock in, I get pulled into the office to be asked ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt this get done‚Äù ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you communicate‚Äù ‚Äúwhy is your in app usage low‚Äù and the list goes on. I always thought of myself as a high performing team member, even during the last 6 months of closing, but our team lead has been doing almost anything possible to prove that I‚Äôm not a productive team member. 

With the passing of Black Friday week, and Cyber Monday week almost finished, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time off screen in fulfillment doing box pulls, and trailer loads for outbound packages (we are a 4 pack station store so this usually takes up a lot of time). I checked the reports from last week, and my in app productivity is 57%. I‚Äôve tried to stress the facts that I‚Äôm always down team members, that I have cleaning and supply tasks as a closer that pull me away from being on screen. But my team lead continues to tell me that it‚Äôs not an excuse, and that my productivity needs to be over 90%. The workload I face doesn‚Äôt seem fair to then be used against me.

988,2309208,Last Day on the Job,"Hey everyone. After almost 3 long years, I'm finally promoting myself to Guest... but the reasoning behind it is bittersweet, yet familiar for a few.

I started in 2020 during the pandemic. I was commuting to school at this point with us no longer being allowed on campus, and needing to make money. Luckily I was hired within a month and quickly adjusted to the role (for context, I worked at a Guest Advocate). During that first year, I picked everything up pretty quickly. I believe everyone always says it but Target isn't a hard job. I got that ""You Make Target"" plaque-thing from my HR ETL and S&E ETL within the first 4-5 months of working there, got moved over to Guest Service and was taught how to close registers. Eventually, that turned into me learning roles around the store. All within the first year of working there. Eventually, I was approached by my HR ETL about being open to Team Leader positions since I was getting ready to graduate from college and would be opening my availability. Being that I wasn't too confident on finding a job right away with my degree, I expressed interest. But it wasn't brought up again until the following year when I applied to be a S&E team lead at another store without speaking to my leadership team (learned my lesson there lol!).

Conveniently enough, my annual review was the next day and my ETL informed me of the proper way to progress with the company as an internal hire, but followed up by telling me that I could be a team lead at my store too! You already know I was down because the pay was good (and even better now) and I didn't see myself leaving Target at least for another year. I quickly agreed. But that's when things went south.

Even though the GSA role doesn't exist anymore, I was a GSA for my store. It was a little weird understanding my role there, but I somewhat picked it up thanks to a few of the leaders. But, the issues rose with the turnover rate for S&E TLs. I was supposed to be trained by my TLs, but (I kid you not) every TL that stepped into the role either quit, got fired, transferred or was promoted to ETL. During my time, up until now, I've had almost 13 S&E ETLs. Only two have stayed longer than 8 months. There was even a point where we didn't have a S&E TL, and I began being coded as a Service & Engagement Team Lead without the ""TL"" thing next to my name on the grid, or with the pay. However, I went along with it and ran the f\*\*\* out of the front the best I could. I won't lie, it turned me into a better leader. I made my mistakes, but being I was the only one they had, they gave me a lot of grace. Now, I know the role like the back of my hand. I ended up training a lot of incoming advocates, the S&E TLs that would come and go, and even a few ETIs who were prepping to go to other stores. It was to the point where I would get asked ""why aren't you a Team Lead at this point"" and that question rang in my head so much... I eventually asked myself the same question. I put my pride aside and decided to apply in Q4 last year when we lost another TL. 

I went through the interview process and, at this point, we had new HR ETL who wasn't the *best* but was cool. He told me that I'd hear back by Q1 since they were still conducting interviews but my S&E ETL told me that I had a great chance of getting it because the whole store knows my capability. Now, rumor has it (from what one of the TLs told me because I'm pretty close with a few) that I *was* picked for the position, but then it was rescinded because we had a TL transfer who needed to come? Wasn't too sure about that but that pissed me off so much. On top of that, I wasn't told personally about my application, despite working there and putting so much effort in. Luckily I got a job that fell in line with my major and accepted the offer around the time I was supposed to hear back about the TL position. With that, I cut my hours and was considering quitting. But, I decided to come back a few months later this year, with the lowered hours, just to make a few extra bucks. 

At this point, the TL who got the spot over me was fired, the S&E ETL I had left to another store, and our HR ETL got fired so it was a wholllleee new slate. I wasn't sure with my availability that I'd be able to become a TL but one of my friends, with the same availability, was approached about it and declined but told me I should talk to our new ETL about it. Again, I put my pride aside and spoke to my S&E ETL who expressed (similarly) that they wanted me to be a TL because of the work I do so I'd know by the following week. This ETL I respect the most because they followed through, but informed me that the position was filled. This time it didn't hurt as much because I was already working my other job, but then (once again) I found myself training the new TL who got the spot.

I hit the brakes and saw the way I was being used. All of the Guest Advocates acknowledge me as a TL, the other TLs see me as a TL, and even a few of the ETL had expressed that they preferred to have me run the front end since I kept everything running smoothly. They come to me for the answers, and the guidance when it comes to the front end stuff like return policies, handing Guest issues and other things, but enough was enough. So I put my two weeks in on Workday, and here we are now. I'll be walking into my last day as an employee there this afternoon, and walking out a free man.

Now, leaving Target is bittersweet. I really do wish I could've stayed because, aside from all the B.S. I endured, I feel like I put so much work into the culture, sales, metrics, whatever and was pushed aside on so many occasions. The job is super easy to me, and I made a lot of friends there. The sad part about it is, if the time comes I would apply back to Target (obv. this time as a Team Lead) but maybe that'll change. It was scary deciding to leave, but I know it's for the best.

Thanks for making it this far if you do, the only thing I'll say to anyone in the same position as me or going through the same B.S. is to value yourself to the highest degree. Don't let yourself get dragged around on empty promises and used until you can't be used anymore because your value will be higher somewhere else.

there are certain people though (about 7 different people i can think of, and that's just the people i know of) who continually misgender me as a woman with no correction or apology, even when i politely interrupt to correct them myself. i have been working with these people for 2 years and despite 2 years of constant correction, they either just don't get it or refuse to respect who i am. i've been to HR AND our store director several times over these two years to report this and many other microaggressions from said TMs AND TLs, including my own department's TL, being told stuff like ""i just can't help but misgender you, youre just so pretty!!!"" and other various horrible comments that make me feel incredibly upset and disrespected. the best theyve done is say ""well, we'll talk to them about it, and in the meantime just keep correcting them!!!"" 

nothing ever comes of these talks, the misgendering and microaggressions still happen several times daily, i have left work crying because of the things i've been told. i started working at Target because i knew they were more progressive (as progressive as a mega retail corp can be, even if its performative) and i wouldn't likely be in as much danger from the constant bigotry that i face in and out of my workplace. i have for the most part felt supported by a majority of my team, and i have a trans TL who i know has my back and will not hesitate to defend me, but the few bad apples that i have to face on the daily have worn me to the metaphorical bone

my cisgender coworkers and TLs and cisgender HR reps do not understand how emotionally exhausting it is to have to correct people about who i am as a person several times a day, and i'm seriously thinking about quitting because of this constant disrespect and constant state of the people above me refusing to actually make a change. it's a fucking joke that they have people take the inclusivity training courses but don't actually enforce the principals they preach, and i'm so so tired. this is is the best paying job that i'm currently qualified for in the town that i live in so i don't want to give up the income, but my mental health is degrading from the state of our store and the way i'm treated. 

i know quitting would be letting them win, but i have no idea what else to do. i don't know where to call above my store, and i'm so scared going above my store director will just make everything worse. i hate feeling so defeated and helpless, this is just who i am and all i want is to be respected and i feel the furthest thing from that üòûüòû",Reddit,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,1

I have an extension that changes the default search engine to a privacy focused one on Edge, and Edge constantly disables it by itself! Sometimes I get a message telling me that it's been disabled due to security for ""making changes to my search engine"", which is the entire point of why I want the extension. Sometimes it just gets disabled with no notification at all. Really annoyed with this.",Reddit,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,1

Currently, I'm at my wits end. I've been an inbound TL for 3 years, always owned PP1s. Hba/OTC/pet/paper/chem. However, my new SD has told me that it's my responsibility for the ENTIRE truck to come clean. I'm not sure how I can do that, when I only work 8 hours. He's told me I have to push, any and all areas that won't come clean without help. I already push like 6 PP1 vehicles a day, I don't have any other time to spare, between doing my morning routines and pushing. My team doesn't get enough hours, so we only come clean with my help. Apparently, I'm also responsible for performancing out DBOs...",Forum,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,1

881,2738985,Service used to be good. Now it‚Äôs as bad as Uber,"I‚Äôve been using Lyft for 4.5 years with a rating of 4.9. Initially, the customer service was great, much better than Uber however, over the years, it has gone downhill.

I had the worst right experience of my life. The other day, the driver was incredibly rude, and he also dropped me off somewhere that I did not recognize. I begged him to help me get situated, and I said I did not know where I was. He said that it was not his problem, because this is where the GPS took him. So I had to walk for 20 minutes in the rain, on an unpaved road, carrying a heavy suitcase. I ended up missing my bus, and had to take one that was one hour and 40 minutes later. It ruined my schedule and caused me so much distress

I reported this issue, requesting a refund. This ride to me much more harm than good, and I missed my bus. I called in about a report, but never heard back. I sent them a message about it, and I did not feel taken seriously. John A Kevin replied & refused to give me a refund, but said that they gave me a $5 credit and to look out for deals. I just cannot understand why they wouldn‚Äôt refund me for a ride that didn‚Äôt even take me to my destination! I did not feel heard as a customer. It‚Äôs not the money that bothers me at this point, but that I wasn‚Äôt taken seriously. 

So Lyft and Uber have an oligopoly over the ride apps, and they‚Äôll both treat you as a number, not as an actual person. I‚Äôm so sad to see how far downhill Lyft has gone.",appstore,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,1
